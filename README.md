## Project Description

I created a simple 'Hello World' app using React. I organiezd the app having it as module as possible. All of the components are contained in the app.js file. Each component then has its own folder in side of a main components folder. Each individual component folder has:
 - style file (scss)
 - test file (jest)
 - meat of the code (jsx)

In the src folder I also have an images folder for any image I used.

## Purpose of the App
